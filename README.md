### Overview

---


The TimerWidget is a customized Flutter widget that displays a circular timer that can be controlled using a slider and play/pause button. It uses the SleekCircularSlider widget from the sleek_circular_slider package to display the circular slider.

The TimerWidget widget is a stateful widget that maintains the state of the timer and the slider. It has three states that the timer can be in: running, paused, and stopped. When the timer is running, it counts down from the selected time, and when it reaches 0, it stops. The timer can be paused and resumed by clicking on the play/pause button.
